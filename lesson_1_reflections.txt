How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it showed the spelling change

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you don't repeat mistakes and can easily return to a working version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro: saves only when there is a change, prevents version bloat
con: might commit too much in one go

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

the whole program requires everything to be kept in sync. Separate files are useful when each document is an independent unit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git diff
git log
git diff first id second id to show the changes
get config --global color-ui auto sets the colours

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

you can easily revert and yours changes will not affect the current commit.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
